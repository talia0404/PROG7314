## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats / what to check

* Even if the SDK / integration is free, **transaction fees** (percentage + maybe fixed amount) are almost always there.
* Location matters. Some gateways are only available in certain countries. If you‚Äôre in South Africa, check whether the gateway supports South African merchants / ZAR, etc.
* Compliance (like PCI-DSS) may require you to do some extra work if you‚Äôre handling card data directly vs using their hosted UI / tokenisation.
* Currency conversion fees, cross-border fees, etc could apply.
