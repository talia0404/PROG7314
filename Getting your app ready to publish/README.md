# üöÄ Deploying Your Android App to Google Play Store

Publishing your Android app is the final milestone before it reaches real users. Follow this guide step-by-step to ensure your app is polished, compliant, and production-ready.

---

## üß© 1. Clean and Prepare Your App

Before you even think of publishing:

* **Versioning:**
  Open your `build.gradle (Module: app)` file and set:

  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      applicationId "com.yourapp.name"
      versionCode 1
      versionName "1.0"
  }
  ```

  Each Play Store update requires a new `versionCode`.

* **Remove debug logs and print statements:**
  Replace any `Log.d()` or `println()` with production-safe logging (or remove them).

* **Turn off debugging:**
  In `AndroidManifest.xml`, make sure:

  ```xml
  android:debuggable="false"
  ```

* **App icon and assets:**
  Go to **app ‚Üí res ‚Üí mipmap** and replace all launcher icons with your final ones.
  You can use Android Studio‚Äôs **Image Asset Studio** to generate proper sizes.

## üîê 2. Create a Signed APK or App Bundle

Play Store no longer accepts APKs - use **Android App Bundle (AAB)**.

### In Android Studio:

1. Click **Build > Generate Signed App Bundle / APK**.

3. Create a new **keystore** (if you don‚Äôt have one):

   * Key alias: `release`
   * Key password: same or new
4. Select your key ‚Üí click **Next** ‚Üí choose **Release** build ‚Üí **Finish**.

You‚Äôll find your `.aab` file in:

```
/app/release/app-release.aab
```

## üßπ 3. Test Your Release Build

Before uploading:

* Install it manually on your phone:

  ```
  adb install app-release.aab
  ```

  or use Android Studio ‚Üí **Build ‚Üí Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** ‚Üí **Locate** ‚Üí **Install**.
