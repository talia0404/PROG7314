# **NotifyMe app** 🚀:

---

### 🛠 Step 1: Create the Project

* Pick a minimum SDK (Android 7.0 / API 24 is safe).

---

### 📄 Step 2: Set Up the Layout

* In your `activity_main.xml`, add **one Button** in the center.
* Give it a label like **"Notify Me"**.
* This will be the trigger for your notifications.

---

### 📋 Step 3: Update the Manifest

* Add the **permission** for posting notifications (needed on Android 13+).
* Make sure your main activity is set as the **launcher** (so it runs first).

---

### 🔔 Step 4: Create a Notification Channel

* Android 8.0+ requires a **channel** so notifications have a home.
* Think of it as a category where all your app’s alerts live.
* Create one with a name (like *NotifyMe Channel*) and a default importance level.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Handle Permissions

* On Android 13+, apps must **ask the user** if they can show notifications.
* When the app opens, request this permission if not already granted.

---

### 📲 Step 6: Build the Notification

* Prepare a notification with:

  * A **small icon** (system icon or custom).
  * A **title** (like *"Ding!"*).
  * A **message** (like *"You clicked the button!"*).
* Set it so tapping the notification reopens your app.

---

### 👆 Step 7: Wire the Button

* Find your button in `MainActivity`.
* When clicked → send the notification.
* Each tap should show a **fresh notification** (not overwrite the old one).

---

### ▶ Step 8: Run and Test

* Run on your emulator or device.
* Tap the button → you should see your notification pop up in the status bar.
* Try it multiple times → each click should stack.

---

🎉 That’s it — you just made a **simple notifications app**. Every click = a little “ping” reminder that your button works.
