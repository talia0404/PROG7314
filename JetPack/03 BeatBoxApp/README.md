# 🎵 BeatBox App – Your Pocket Playlist Demo

Welcome to **BeatBox**, a mini music playlist app built with **Jetpack Compose**!
This project isn’t about Spotify-level streaming — it’s about showcasing some of the coolest UI components Compose has to offer while keeping things fun and visual.

## ✨ What BeatBox Does

* 📜 **Song List** – Add tracks, mark favourites, and clear them out.
* 💿 **Album Grid** – Browse albums in a smooth, scrollable grid.
* 🔍 **Search Bar** – Quickly filter songs and albums.
* 🧹 **Clear & Snackbar** – Remove songs and get instant feedback.
* 🔄 **Pull-to-Refresh** – Shuffle the playlist with a satisfying refresh.
* ❤️ **Favourites Tab** – Keep your top tracks one tap away.

## 🎯 Why This App

*  To learn **state-driven UI** in Compose.
*  To see **recomposition** in action.
*  To explore real-world UI patterns (navigation, lists, grids, search).
*  To experiment with **Material 3 components** and modern Android design.


Think of BeatBox as your friendly, playful jukebox 🎶
