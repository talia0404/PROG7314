# What is **Android Jetpack**? ðŸš€

A collection of official Android libraries, tools, and guidance from Google that help you build apps faster and with fewer bugs. Theyâ€™re versioned independently of the OS, so you can ship features without waiting for Android releases.

Common Jetpack libraries youâ€™ll use:

* **Lifecycle & ViewModel** â€“ survive config changes and manage UI state.
* **Navigation** â€“ type-safe navigation and back-stack handling.
* **Room** â€“ local database on device.
* **DataStore** â€“ key-value/proto storage (replacement for SharedPreferences).
* **WorkManager** â€“ deferrable/background work.
* **Paging** â€“ efficient infinite lists.
* **Hilt** â€“ dependency injection.
* **CameraX**, **Compose**, **Glance** (widgets), testing libs, and more.

# What is **Jetpack Compose**? ðŸŽ¨

Googleâ€™s modern **declarative** UI toolkit for native Android written in Kotlin.

* You describe UI with **@Composable** functions; the framework updates the screen when state changes.
* **Less XML/boilerplate**, powerful **Previews**, built-in **Material 3** theming, easy **animations** and **accessibility**.
* **Interoperates** with existing Views (you can mix Compose and XML).
* Scales from small components to entire apps.

Tiny example:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String) { Text("Hello, $name!") }
```

# What can you use them for? ðŸ§©

* **End-to-end Android apps**: structure (MVVM with ViewModel), navigation, storage (Room/DataStore), background jobs (WorkManager), DI (Hilt).
* **Modern UIs with Compose**: forms, lists (LazyColumn), theming, animations, dialogs, snackbars, adaptive layouts for phones/tablets.
* **Performance & quality**: paging large feeds, CameraX for camera features, testing (JUnit/Espresso/Compose testing).

# When to choose what?

* **New app** â†’ go **Compose-first**; itâ€™s the current Android recommendation.
* **Existing XML app** â†’ adopt **hybrid**: add Compose screens gradually while keeping legacy Views.
* Teaching/learning or prototyping â†’ Compose speeds iteration and previewing.
